Move
The base speed of each unit is 4.
A unit may move through friendly units but not through
enemy units, and must end its movement in a nonoccupied
hex.
A single-based unit may move a number of hexes up to
its speed.
Double-based units move one of their halves into an
space adjacent to that half, then move the other half
into the space the first half just vacated.
Alternately, both halves may be moved in a single
direction, keeping them in the same relationship to one
another. No part of the unit may move through other
units or a wall. If this move is made with a non-flying
unit, the move is stopped if either half enters hindering
terrain or cover.
Terrain
Open Does not block LOS, no effect on movement.
Hindering Yellow Does not block LOS. Units entering
hindering terrain must immediately end their move
action.
Walls Black Block LOS and movement. Units can fly
over them.
Covering Green Does not block LOS. Affects movement
like hindering terrain. Reduces damage by -1.
